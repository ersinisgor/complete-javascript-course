## How to Play

1- At the beginning of the game, the computer randomly selects the starting player. The selected player is marked as "Active."

2 -The "Active" player can click the "Roll Dice" button to roll a six-sided die. The number rolled will be displayed in the "Current" score section.

3- If the player rolls a "1," they lose their current score, and it becomes the other player's turn.

4- If the player rolls any other number, that number is added to their current score.

5- The player can continue rolling the die as many times as they want to accumulate points in their current score. To secure these points, they can click the "Hold" button. The current score is then added to their total score, and it becomes the other player's turn.

6- The game continues in this manner until one of the players reaches a total score of 100 points or more.

7- The player who reaches 100 points first wins the game. Their name will be displayed as the "Winner."
